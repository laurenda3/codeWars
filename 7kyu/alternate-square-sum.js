// For empty arrays, result should be zero (except for Haskell).

// Note
// The values at even positions need to be squared. For a language with zero-based indices, this will occur at oddly-indexed locations. For instance, in Python, the values at indices 1, 3, 5, etc. should be squared because these are the second, fourth, and sixth positions in the list.

// Example
// [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]  -->  379
// # 1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  position

// 11 + 12^2 + 13 + 14^2 + 15 = 379
// Explanation:

// Elements at indices 0, 2, 4 are 11, 13, 15 and they are at odd positions as 11 is at position #1, 13 is at position #3 and 15 at #5.

// Elements at indices 1, 3 are 12 and 14 and they are at even position. So we need to add 11, 13, 15 as they are and square of 12 and 14

// My solution:

// function alternateSqSum(arr){
// return arr.reduce(function(prev, curr, index) {
//   return prev + (index % 2 ? Math.pow(curr, 2) : curr)
// }, 0)
                 
// }
const alternateSqSum = arr => arr.reduce(function(acc, curr, index){
  return acc + (index % 2 ? Math.pow(curr, 2) : curr)}, 0)
